                <p>This is a thumbnail for a youtube video about a short indie game called Aperture Desk Job. This is a short demo game released by the game publisher Valve and takes place in one of their best-selling franchises, Portal.</p>

                <p>This is a project for a creative technologies class that entailed finding a place out in public and making some non-permanent vandalism that included the environment. We could also take a picture of the enivronment and photoshop it instead so that is what I did here.</p>

                <p>This is a Logo that I did for a youtube channel which is a very minimalist design that gets straight to the point.</p>
